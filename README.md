### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Frontend Developer with a strong focus on Vue/Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS, and
clean architecture.
Confident in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I work comfortably with both REST
and GraphQL APIs. Iâ€™ve built full-featured CRM systems from scratch and
quickly adapt to new technologies.
